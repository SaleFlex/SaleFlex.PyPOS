class ClosureEvent:
    """
    Closure Event Handler for end-of-day operations.
    
    This class handles end-of-day closure operations including:
    - Daily sales closing
    - Cash drawer reconciliation
    - Financial reporting
    - Transaction finalization
    - Z-report generation
    
    All methods follow the pattern of returning True on success, False on failure,
    and handle authentication checks where appropriate.

        Handle end-of-day closure operation.
        
        This method performs the complete end-of-day closure process, including:
        1. Verify cashier authorization
        2. Calculate daily totals (sales, payments, taxes)
        3. Generate Z-report
        4. Close cash drawer
        5. Archive transactions
        6. Reset daily counters

        and cannot be performed if there are unclosed transactions.
