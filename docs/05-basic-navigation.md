# Basic Navigation

## Main Menu

After logging in, you'll see the main menu with options for:

- **Configuration**: System settings and customization
- **Logout**: Exit current user session

## Using the NumPad

The NumPad interface allows for quick numeric input:

1. Tap the digits to enter numbers
2. Use "Backspace" to delete the last character
3. "Clear" will reset the entire input
4. "Enter" confirms your entry

### Quantity Input for PLU Sales

When selling products by PLU code or barcode, you can specify the quantity using the NumPad:

1. **Enter quantity**: Type the desired quantity (e.g., "2" for 2 items) on the NumPad
2. **Select product**: Click the PLU code or barcode button for the product
3. **Automatic processing**: The system will add the specified quantity of that product to the sale
4. **Auto-clear**: After the sale, the NumPad is automatically cleared for the next entry

**Example:**
- Enter "3" on the NumPad
- Click a product button (PLU code or barcode)
- Result: 3 units of that product are added to the sale list

**Note:** If no quantity is entered (NumPad is empty), the default quantity of 1 is used.

## Processing a Sale

1. From the main menu, select "Sales"
2. Scan products using a barcode scanner or enter item codes manually using the NumPad
3. **For multiple quantities**: Enter quantity on NumPad, then click the product button
4. Adjust quantities as needed
5. When all items are added, complete the transaction
6. Print a receipt for the customer
